# CRITICAL: PocketBase Permissions Setup Required

## Problem 1: Social Feed Shows "Unknown User"

The social feed was showing "Unknown User" instead of actual user names because the `users` collection had restrictive **List** and **View** rules.

### Required Fix for Social Feed

Update BOTH the **List** and **View** rules for the `users` collection:

**List Rule:**

```javascript
@request.auth.id != ""
```

**View Rule:**

```javascript
@request.auth.id != ""
```

This allows any authenticated user to view other users' basic information (name, profile picture), which is essential for social features.

### Steps to Fix:

1. Go to PocketBase Admin Dashboard: `https://pb.lexserver.org/_/`
2. Collections ‚Üí **users** ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** ‚Üí **API Rules**
3. Update **List** rule to: `@request.auth.id != ""`
4. Update **View** rule to: `@request.auth.id != ""`
5. Click **Save**
6. Users must **log out and log back in** for changes to take effect

## Problem 2: Profile Image Upload (If Applicable)

Regular members (membership_type = 3) **cannot** update their profile images if the update rule only allows admins.

### Required Fix for Profile Updates

Update the `users` collection **Update Rule** to:

```javascript
@request.auth.id != "" && (@request.auth.membership_type = 1 || @request.auth.membership_type = 2 || @request.auth.id = id)
```

This rule allows:

- ‚úÖ Super Admins (membership_type = 1) to update **any** user
- ‚úÖ Admins (membership_type = 2) to update **any** user
- ‚úÖ **Regular members to update THEIR OWN records** (`@request.auth.id = id`)

### Step 2: How to Update in PocketBase

1. Open your PocketBase Admin Dashboard at: `https://pb.lexserver.org/_/`
2. Click on **Collections** in the sidebar
3. Find and click on **users** collection
4. Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** icon
5. Go to the **API Rules** tab
6. Find the **Update** rule field
7. Replace the existing rule with the new rule above
8. Click **Save**

## What Was Fixed in the Code

### 1. Fixed Field Name Mapping

- PocketBase actually uses `profile_image` (snake_case), not `profileImage` (camelCase)
- Added proper field name conversion from `profile_image` to `profileImage` in the authentication repository
- Fixed Post and PostComment models to read `profile_image` from expanded user records

### 2. Fixed File Upload Method

- Changed from `body: { field: MultipartFile }` to `files: [MultipartFile]`
- This fixes the `JsonUnsupportedObjectError` you were seeing

## Testing After Fix

After updating the PocketBase rule:

1. **Login as a regular member** (membership_type = 3)
2. **Go to Account Information page**
3. **Click "Upload Image"**
4. **Select a photo**
5. **Should now work successfully!** ‚úÖ

## What You Should See in Logs (Success)

```
I/flutter: PocketBaseService - File fields: [profileImage]
I/flutter: PocketBaseService - Uploading file for field: profileImage
I/flutter: PocketBaseService - File size: 148845 bytes
I/flutter: PocketBaseService - File uploaded successfully ‚úÖ
```

## Important Notes

### Your Current PocketBase Configuration

Based on your collection export, your `users` collection has:

- Field name: **`profileImage`** (camelCase) ‚úÖ
- Field type: **file** ‚úÖ
- Max select: **1** ‚úÖ

The field is configured correctly - you just need to update the **Update Rule** to allow regular members to update their own records.

### Security Note

The new update rule is **secure** because:

- Regular members can **ONLY** update their own records (`@request.auth.id = id`)
- They **cannot** update other users' records
- Admins can still update any user's records
- The rule requires authentication (`@request.auth.id != ""`)

## Files Modified

### Core Service

- `lib/services/pocketbase_service.dart` - Fixed file upload method from `body` to `files` parameter

### UI Pages with State Refresh

- `lib/app/pages/current_user_account_page.dart` - **Added auth store refresh after image upload** so the UI updates immediately

**Key Fix**: After uploading, we now refresh the PocketBase auth store:

```dart
// Manually update the auth store with the new user data
pb.authStore.save(pb.authStore.token, updatedRecord);
```

This triggers the AuthBloc stream to update, causing the UI to refresh and show the new profile image immediately.

### Models (Field Name Consistency)

- `lib/models/post_comment.dart`
- `lib/models/post.dart`
- `lib/models/attendance.dart`
- `lib/app/pages/user_detail_page.dart`

### Repository

- `packages/authentication_repository/lib/src/profile_repository.dart` - Removed unnecessary field conversion

## Vehicle Photo Upload Feature

### Good News!

The `vehicles` collection **already has the correct permissions** for members to update their own vehicles:

```javascript
"updateRule": "@request.auth.id != \"\" && (user = @request.auth.id || @request.auth.membership_type = 1 || @request.auth.membership_type = 2)"
```

The `user = @request.auth.id` part allows users to update vehicles where they are the owner. ‚úÖ

### New Features Added

1. **Vehicle Information Display** - Account Information page now shows vehicle details
2. **Primary Vehicle Photo Upload** - Members can tap the camera icon on the main vehicle photo to upload/update it
3. **Additional Vehicle Photos** - Members can upload multiple additional photos (up to 6) using the "Add Photos" button
   - Select multiple photos at once from gallery (max 6)
   - Photos display in a 3-column grid
   - Shows photo count (e.g., "3/6 photos")
   - Shows upload progress
   - Automatic limit: if more than 6 selected, only first 6 are uploaded
4. **Edit Contact Information** - Members can update their own contact details
   - Edit icon (pencil) in Contact Information section
   - Update: Contact Number, Emergency Contact Name/Number, Spouse Name/Number
   - Email is read-only and cannot be edited
   - Clean, scrollable dialog interface
   - All changes save to PocketBase and update immediately
5. **Immediate UI Update** - All changes show immediately after save (no app restart needed)

The vehicle photo upload uses the same corrected approach as the profile image upload (`files` parameter), with enhanced support for multiple file uploads.
