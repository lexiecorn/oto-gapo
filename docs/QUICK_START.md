# Quick Start Guide - Your Next Steps

**Status:** ‚úÖ CI/CD Infrastructure Complete  
**What's left:** Configuration and deployment (your actions needed)

---

## üìã Your Action Items

### Step 1: Make Scripts Executable (2 minutes)

**Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt):** Scripts work as-is with Git Bash or WSL

**Unix/Mac/Linux:**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/bump_version.sh
chmod +x scripts/build_production.sh
chmod +x scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh
```

### Step 2: Test Local Build (10 minutes)

```bash
# Build production release
./scripts/build_production.sh both

# Expected output: AAB and APK files in build/app/outputs/
```

‚úÖ **Success:** Build completes without errors  
‚ùå **Failed:** See [Local Build Testing Guide](docs/LOCAL_BUILD_TESTING.md)

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets (15 minutes)

```bash
# Run helper script
./scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh

# Follow the output to add secrets to GitHub
```

**What to configure:**

1. Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add these 5 secrets (values from script output):
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
   - `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
   - `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (you'll get this later)

**Detailed guide:** [docs/NEXT_STEPS.md#github-configuration](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md#github-configuration)

### Step 4: Create Privacy Policy (1-2 hours)

1. Open `docs/PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Replace all [placeholders] with your information
3. Host on your website or GitHub Pages
4. Save the URL (you'll need it for Play Store)

**Quick option:** Use [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/)

### Step 5: Prepare Play Store Assets (2-4 hours)

**Feature Graphic:**

- Size: 1024 x 500 pixels
- Tool: Canva (easiest, has templates)

**Screenshots:**

- Capture 2-8 app screenshots
- Size: 1080 x 1920 recommended
- Screens: Login, Dashboard, Profile, Payments, Announcements

**Tip:** Use [Device Frames](https://deviceframes.com/) for professional look

### Step 6: Set Up Play Console (2-4 hours)

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create developer account ($25 one-time fee)
3. Wait for approval (24-48 hours usually)
4. Create app listing
5. Upload assets
6. Complete all sections

**Complete guide:** [docs/PLAY_STORE_SETUP.md](docs/PLAY_STORE_SETUP.md)

### Step 7: Configure Play Console API (30 minutes)

**Needed for automated uploads:**

1. Enable Google Play Developer API
2. Create service account
3. Download JSON key
4. Grant permissions in Play Console
5. Add JSON to GitHub Secrets as `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`

**Step-by-step:** [docs/PLAY_STORE_SETUP.md#google-play-console-api-setup](docs/PLAY_STORE_SETUP.md#google-play-console-api-setup)

### Step 8: Install Fastlane (5 minutes)

```bash
cd android
bundle install
```

If `bundle` not found:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Step 9: First Release (10 minutes)

```bash
# Tag the current version
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Build AAB/APK
# - Run tests
# - Create GitHub Release
# - Upload to Play Store internal track
```

**Monitor:** GitHub Actions tab in your repository

### Step 10: Test & Promote (1-2 weeks recommended)

1. Test on internal track
2. Fix any issues
3. Promote to beta track
4. Get wider feedback
5. Submit to production

## üÜò Need Help?

**If something fails:**

1. Check the relevant documentation (see table above)
2. Look in [docs/NEXT_STEPS.md - Troubleshooting](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md#troubleshooting)

4. Check Play Console help center

**Common issues:**

- **Build fails:** Check [docs/LOCAL_BUILD_TESTING.md](docs/LOCAL_BUILD_TESTING.md)
- **GitHub Actions fails:** Verify GitHub Secrets
- **Upload fails:** Check service account permissions
- **Can't install Fastlane:** Make sure Ruby is installed

## üöÄ After First Release

Once your app is live, future releases are much faster:

```bash
# Make changes
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git commit -am "feat: add feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Merge PR to main

# Bump version
./scripts/bump_version.sh minor

# Tag and push
git add pubspec.yaml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version"
git push origin main
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0

# Done! CI/CD handles the rest (10 minutes)
```
