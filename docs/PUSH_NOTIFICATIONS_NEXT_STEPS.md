# Push Notifications - Next Steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update

**Firebase Legacy API has been disabled** (July 2024). The current implementation needs to be migrated to HTTP v1 API, which requires a backend service.

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Push notification code implementation
- [x] PocketBase database fields added (`fcm_token` and `notification_topics`)
- [x] FCM token generation working
- [x] Topic subscriptions working

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Required: Migrate to FCM HTTP v1 API

### Current Status

The app currently uses the **deprecated Legacy API** which no longer works. You need to migrate to **FCM HTTP v1 API** using a backend service.

**See migration guide:** `docs/FCM_LEGACY_API_MIGRATION.md`

### Quick Summary

The HTTP v1 API requires:

- Service account credentials (JSON file from Firebase)
- OAuth 2.0 token generation
- Backend server (cannot be done in Flutter)

**Recommended solution:** Use n8n workflow to handle FCM v1 API requests.

**Setup guide:** `docs/N8N_FCM_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md`

### What Still Works

‚úÖ FCM token generation (receiving notifications)  
‚úÖ Topic subscriptions  
‚úÖ Notification permissions  
‚ùå Sending notifications (needs migration)

### 2. iOS Setup (If deploying to iOS)

If you're deploying to iOS devices, complete these steps:

#### A. Enable Push Notifications in Xcode

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select **Runner** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Click **"+ Capability"**
5. Add **"Push Notifications"**

#### B. Configure APNs in Firebase

1. In Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. Under **Apple app configuration**, upload your APNs Authentication Key or Certificate
3. Follow the [Firebase iOS setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client)

**Note**: Android is already fully configured! No additional steps needed.

### 3. Test the Implementation

Run these tests in your app:

#### A. Test FCM Token Generation

1. Launch the app
2. Log in with any user
3. Navigate to **Notification Settings** page
4. You should see your FCM token displayed
5. Check PocketBase to verify the token was saved to the `fcm_token` field

#### B. Test Topic Subscriptions

1. In the app, go to **Notification Settings**
2. Subscribe to a topic (e.g., "announcements")
3. Check PocketBase to verify it's saved in `notification_topics` as JSON array

#### C. Test Sending Notifications

**From Admin Panel:**

1. Navigate to **Admin Panel ‚Üí Send Notification**
2. Paste your Firebase Server Key
3. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Notification"
   - Body: "This is a test message"
   - Type: Select any type
   - Target: Select "topic"
   - Topic: Select "announcements"
4. Click **Send Notification**
5. You should receive the notification on your device

**Test different scenarios:**

- ‚úÖ **Foreground**: App is open and active
- ‚úÖ **Background**: App is minimized
- ‚úÖ **Terminated**: App is completely closed
- ‚úÖ **Deep Links**: Tap notification and verify it navigates to correct page

### 4. Test Deep Linking

Send notifications with different types and verify navigation:

| Notification Type | Should Navigate To      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `meeting`         | Meeting Details Page    |
| `announcement`    | Announcements List Page |
| `payment`         | Profile Page            |
| `post`            | Post Detail Page        |
| `general`         | Home Page               |

### 5. Production Deployment

Once everything is tested:

1. Build your production app
2. Deploy to app stores (Google Play Store / Apple App Store)
3. Monitor notification delivery in Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Delivery statistics

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: "FCM token not generated"

**Solution**:

- Verify Firebase project is properly configured
- Check `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are in place
- Check app logs for Firebase initialization errors

### Problem: "Notifications not received"

**Solution**:

- Verify notification permissions are granted on device
- Check Firebase Server Key is correct
- Verify device has internet connection
- Check FCM token is valid and not expired

### Problem: "Deep links not working"

**Solution**:

- Verify notification data payload includes correct `type` field
- Check routes are properly registered in `app_router.dart`
- Verify the app is opened (not just the notification handler triggered)

### Problem: "iOS notifications not working"

**Solution**:

- Verify Push Notifications capability is enabled in Xcode
- Check APNs configuration in Firebase Console
- Ensure you're using a physical iOS device (not simulator)
- Verify certificates are valid in Apple Developer Portal

## üìä Monitoring

Monitor notification delivery in Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. View **Delivery statistics**
3. Check **Notifications** tab for success/failure rates
4. Review **User engagement** metrics
