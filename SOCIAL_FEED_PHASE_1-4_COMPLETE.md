# Social Feed Implementation - Phases 1-4 Complete ✅

## Summary

I've successfully completed **Phases 1-4** of the social feed implementation (backend, models, services, and state management). This represents approximately **40-50% of the total implementation**.

---

## What's Been Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Setup

- **PocketBase Schema**: Created complete schema for 5 collections:

  - `posts` - User posts with images and captions
  - `post_reactions` - 6 reaction types (like, love, wow, haha, sad, angry)
  - `post_comments` - Comments with @mentions and #hashtags
  - `post_reports` - User reports for moderation
  - `user_bans` - Admin bans (temporary or permanent)

- **Files Created**:
  - `pocketbase/social_feed_collections_schema.json` - Import-ready schema
  - `docs/SOCIAL_FEED_SCHEMA.md` - Comprehensive schema documentation

### ✅ Phase 2: Data Models

- **5 Complete Models** with `fromRecord()` factories:
  - `Post` (lib/models/post.dart) - 14 fields, computed `isVisible` property
  - `PostReaction` (lib/models/post_reaction.dart) - With `ReactionType` enum
  - `PostComment` (lib/models/post_comment.dart) - With `canEdit` logic (5 min window)
  - `PostReport` (lib/models/post_report.dart) - With `ReportReason` and `ReportStatus` enums
  - `UserBan` (lib/models/user_ban.dart) - With `BanType` enum and `isExpired` logic

### ✅ Phase 3: Repository Layer

- **Image Compression Utility** (`lib/utils/image_compression_utils.dart`):

  - Compress images to < 1MB
  - Max resolution: 720p (1280x720)
  - JPEG quality: 80%
  - Automatic dimension calculation
  - Progressive quality reduction if needed

- **Text Parsing Utility** (`lib/utils/text_parsing_utils.dart`):

  - Extract @mentions and #hashtags with regex
  - Convert to tappable RichText spans
  - Real-time parsing support
  - Validation methods

- **Extended PocketBaseService** (30+ new methods):

  - **Posts**: create, update, delete, hide, get (with filters), getUserPosts
  - **Reactions**: add, remove, get, getUserReaction, updateCount
  - **Comments**: add, update, delete, hide, get (paginated)
  - **Reports**: reportPost, reportComment, getReports, updateReportStatus
  - **Bans**: banUser, unbanUser, checkUserBan, getUserBans, getAllBans
  - **Utilities**: getPostImageUrl with thumbnail support

- **Dependencies Added** (6 packages):
  - `image: ^4.0.0` - Image manipulation
  - `flutter_image_compress: ^2.1.0` - Better compression
  - `cached_network_image: ^3.3.0` - Image caching
  - `photo_view: ^0.14.0` - Full-screen viewer
  - `timeago: ^3.5.0` - Relative timestamps
  - `path_provider: ^2.1.0` - File system access

### ✅ Phase 4: State Management (BLoC/Cubit)

- **FeedCubit** (`lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/feed_cubit.dart`):

  - Load feed with pagination & infinite scroll
  - Load user posts & hashtag posts
  - Create posts with auto compression
  - Delete posts
  - Toggle reactions (optimistic UI)
  - Track user reactions
  - Refresh posts
  - Ban validation

- **CommentCubit** (`lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/comment_cubit.dart`):

  - Load comments with pagination
  - Add comments with mention/hashtag parsing
  - Update comments (5-minute edit window)
  - Delete comments
  - Refresh & clear state
  - Ban validation

- **ModerationCubit** (`lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/moderation_cubit.dart`):
  - Load reports filtered by status
  - Review reports with admin notes
  - Hide/unhide posts & comments
  - Ban/unban users (temp or permanent)
  - Load bans & user ban history
  - Support for ban types: post, comment, all

## Code Statistics

- **New Files**: 15 (models, utilities, cubits, states, docs)
- **Modified Files**: 2 (pubspec.yaml, pocketbase_service.dart)
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,500+ lines
- **Methods Created**: 50+ (service methods, model methods, cubit methods)
- **Enums Created**: 5 (ReactionType, ReportReason, ReportStatus, BanType, FeedStatus, etc.)

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 📋 Phase 5: UI Implementation (7-10 days)

This is the largest remaining phase:

1. **Social Feed Page** - Main scrollable feed with infinite scroll
2. **Create Post Page** - Image picker, caption input, preview
3. **Post Detail Page** - Full post view, reactions, comments section
4. **Post Card Widget** - Reusable post display component
5. **Comment Item Widget** - Reusable comment display
6. **Reaction Picker Widget** - Bottom sheet with 6 reactions
7. **User Posts Page** - Grid view of user's posts (Instagram-style)
8. **Hashtag Posts Page** - Posts filtered by hashtag
9. **Admin Moderation Dashboard** - 3 tabs (Reports, Hidden Content, Bans)
10. **Report Dialog** - Report inappropriate content

### 📋 Phase 6: Routing (1-2 days)

- Add routes to `app_router.dart`
- Generate route files with `auto_route_generator`
- Add navigation entry points

### 📋 Phase 7: Integration (1 day)

- Add "Social Feed Moderation" to AdminPage
- Add "Social Feed" to main navigation
- Wire up all navigation

### 📋 Phase 8: Testing (3-4 days)

- Unit tests for utilities
- Widget tests for components
- Integration tests for key flows

### 📋 Phase 9: Documentation (1-2 days)

- Implementation guide
- Moderation guide
- Update API docs
- Update roadmap

## How to Continue

### Next Immediate Steps:

1. **Import PocketBase Schema** (Manual step):

   ```
   - Go to https://pb.lexserver.org/_/
   - Settings → Import collections
   - Upload: pocketbase/social_feed_collections_schema.json
   - Verify all 5 collections are created
   ```

2. **Start Phase 5 (UI)**:

   - Begin with main feed page
   - Create reusable widgets (post card, comment item)
   - Build create post flow
   - Implement reaction picker
   - Add comment functionality
   - Build admin moderation dashboard

3. **Testing as You Go**:
   - Test each UI component
   - Verify state management works correctly
   - Test image upload and compression
   - Validate mention/hashtag parsing

## Key Technical Highlights

### Image Compression Strategy

- Target: Mobile-optimized (720p, <1MB)
- Smart quality reduction algorithm
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Validates before upload

### Reaction System

- 6 emoji types inspired by Facebook
- One reaction per user per post
- Can change reaction type
- Optimistic UI for instant feedback
- Cached counts on posts

### Mention/Hashtag System

- Regex-based extraction
- Tappable in UI via RichText
- Stored as JSON arrays
- Searchable in database
- Real-time parsing

### Moderation System

- Soft deletes (recoverable)
- Admin hide/unhide
- Temporary & permanent bans
- Ban types: post, comment, all
- Auto-expiry for temp bans
- Audit trail (reviewed_by, reviewed_at)

### Performance Optimizations

- Pagination (20 items/page)
- Cached reaction counts
- Cached comment counts
- Optimistic UI updates
- Image caching
- Lazy loading

## Files to Review

### Must Review:

1. `docs/SOCIAL_FEED_SCHEMA.md` - Understand the data structure
2. `lib/services/pocketbase_service.dart` (lines 1795-2486) - Social feed methods
3. `lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/feed_cubit.dart` - Core state management

### Supporting Files:

4. All model files in `lib/models/post*.dart` and `lib/models/user_ban.dart`
5. Utility files in `lib/utils/`
6. State files in `lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/*_state.dart`

---

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Soft Deletes**: Use `is_active` flag instead of hard deletes for recovery
2. **Admin Flag**: Separate `is_hidden_by_admin` for moderation without deletion
3. **Denormalized Data**: Store user names in posts/comments for performance
4. **Cached Counts**: Store reaction/comment counts on posts to avoid expensive queries
5. **Ban Validation**: Check bans before allowing create operations
6. **Optimistic UI**: Update UI immediately, then sync with server
7. **JSON Storage**: Use JSON arrays for hashtags/mentions (searchable in PocketBase)
8. **Mobile-First**: Image compression optimized for mobile viewing
9. **5-Minute Edit**: Comments editable for 5 minutes (matches industry standard)
10. **Expandable Relations**: Use PocketBase expand for efficient data loading

## Estimated Remaining Time

- **Phase 5 (UI)**: 7-10 days ⏱️
- **Phase 6 (Routing)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 7 (Integration)**: 1 day
- **Phase 8 (Testing)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 9 (Documentation)**: 1-2 days
