### Mention/Hashtag System

- Regex-based extraction
- Tappable in UI via RichText
- Stored as JSON arrays
- Searchable in database
- Real-time parsing

### Moderation System

- Soft deletes (recoverable)
- Admin hide/unhide
- Temporary & permanent bans
- Ban types: post, comment, all
- Auto-expiry for temp bans
- Audit trail (reviewed_by, reviewed_at)

### Performance Optimizations

## Files to Review

### Must Review:

1. `docs/SOCIAL_FEED_SCHEMA.md` - Understand the data structure
2. `lib/services/pocketbase_service.dart` (lines 1795-2486) - Social feed methods
3. `lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/feed_cubit.dart` - Core state management

### Supporting Files:

4. All model files in `lib/models/post*.dart` and `lib/models/user_ban.dart`
5. Utility files in `lib/utils/`
6. State files in `lib/app/modules/social_feed/bloc/*_state.dart`

---

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Soft Deletes**: Use `is_active` flag instead of hard deletes for recovery
2. **Admin Flag**: Separate `is_hidden_by_admin` for moderation without deletion
3. **Denormalized Data**: Store user names in posts/comments for performance
4. **Cached Counts**: Store reaction/comment counts on posts to avoid expensive queries
5. **Ban Validation**: Check bans before allowing create operations
6. **Optimistic UI**: Update UI immediately, then sync with server
7. **JSON Storage**: Use JSON arrays for hashtags/mentions (searchable in PocketBase)
8. **Mobile-First**: Image compression optimized for mobile viewing
9. **5-Minute Edit**: Comments editable for 5 minutes (matches industry standard)
10. **Expandable Relations**: Use PocketBase expand for efficient data loading
