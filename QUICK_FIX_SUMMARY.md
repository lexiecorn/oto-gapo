# Quick Fix Summary - Push Notifications

## Problem
Notifications successfully sent from n8n/Firebase but not received in app.

## Root Cause Fixed ✅
**Android Notification Channel Missing**: Android requires channels to be created programmatically. Channel was defined in manifest but never created at runtime.

## Fix Applied
Added notification channel creation in `MainActivity.kt`:
```kotlin
private fun createNotificationChannel() {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
        val channel = NotificationChannel(
            "otogapo_notifications",
            "OtoGapo Notifications",
            NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
        ).apply {
            description = "OtoGapo push notifications"
            enableVibration(true)
            enableLights(true)
        }
        
        val notificationManager = getSystemService(NotificationManager::class.java)
        notificationManager?.createNotificationChannel(channel)
    }
}
```

## Other Fixes
1. Added `flutter_local_notifications` dependency
2. Fixed PocketBase singleton access (changed to getter)
3. Enhanced logging for debugging

## Critical Next Step ⚠️
**Must rebuild** (not hot restart) because native Android code changed:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart -d 22101316UG
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] App rebuilt successfully
- [ ] Check logs for "Notification channel created"
- [ ] Check logs for "FCM token obtained"
- [ ] Login and check logs for "FCM token saved successfully"
- [ ] Send test notification from Firebase Console
- [ ] Verify notification received

## If Still Not Working
Check these logs:
1. `NotificationService: Permission status:`
2. `NotificationService: Initial token obtained:`
3. `MainActivity: Notification channel created`
4. `NotificationService: Foreground message received:` (if app open)
