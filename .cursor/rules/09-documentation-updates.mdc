description: Require documentation updates for code changes

## Documentation Update Policy

- **Always update documentation** when making code changes that affect:

  - Public APIs or interfaces
  - Architecture or design patterns
  - New features or modules
  - Configuration or setup steps
  - Deployment procedures
  - Breaking changes

- **Documentation locations** to update:

  - `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - for API changes, endpoints, and service interfaces
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - for architectural changes, patterns, or module structure
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - for deployment, build, or CI/CD changes
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - for development setup, workflows, or tooling changes
  - `README.md` - for project overview, quick start, or major feature changes
  - Package-level `README.md` files in `packages/` - for package-specific changes

- **Documentation update workflow**:

  1. After implementing code changes, identify which documentation files need updates
  2. Update the relevant documentation with clear, accurate information
  3. Ensure examples and code snippets in documentation are current
  4. Update version numbers or changelogs if applicable
  5. Verify that documentation changes are included in the same change set

- **When to skip documentation updates**:

  - Internal refactoring that doesn't change behavior
  - Bug fixes that don't alter functionality
  - Formatting or style-only changes
  - Private helper functions or internal implementation details

- **Best practices**:
  - Write documentation in clear, concise language
  - Include code examples where appropriate
  - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
  - Document the "why" not just the "what"
  - Use markdown formatting consistently
